In MATLAB, there is a handy function called reshape which can reshape an m x n matrix into a new one with a different size r x c keeping its original data.

You are given an m x n matrix mat and two integers r and c representing the row number and column number of the wanted reshaped matrix.

The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.

If the reshape operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

 

class Solution {
    public int[][] matrixReshape(int[][] nums, int r, int c) {
        
         int totalElements = nums.length * nums[0].length;
        if (totalElements != r * c || totalElements % r != 0) {
            return nums;
        }
        final int[][] result = new int[r][c];
        int newR = 0;
        int newC = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < nums[i].length; j++) {
                result[newR][newC] = nums[i][j];
                newC++;
                if (newC == c) {
                    newC = 0;
                    newR++;
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
        
    }
}
